Classic IE</span>
is a
small plugin for Internet Explorer that:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Adds a caption to the title
bar so you can see the full title of the page</li>
  <li>Shows the security zone in the status bar</li>
  <li>Shows the loading progress in the status bar</li>
</ul>
<br>
See the full page title even when it doesn't fit in the tab:<br>
<img style="width: 748px; height: 190px;" alt="" src="images/ie9_caption.png"><br>
<br>See the progress and the security zone:<br>
<img style="width: 429px; height: 56px;" alt="" src="images/ie9_status.png"><br>
<br>
<h1><a name="install"></a>Installation</h1>
When you run Internet Explorer for the first time after installing
Classic IE it may prompt you that a new add-on called ClassicIEBHO is
installed and if you want to enable it. Click on the Enable button. If
you don't get a prompt, go to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tools -&gt; Manage add-ons</span> and make sure ClassicIEBHO is enabled. After enabling the add-on you have to restart Internet Explorer to activate the plugin.<br>
<br>
<h1><a name="settings"></a>Settings</h1>
You can access the settings from <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tools -&gt; Classic IE Settings</span>
or from the start menu. The settings control the color and the font of
the caption, and what information to display on the status bar.<br>
<img style="width: 683px; height: 438px;" alt="" src="images/ie9_settings.png"><br>
<br>You can choose from seeing only the basic settings, or all
available settings. Hover over each setting to see a description of
what it's for. Type in the search box to find a setting by name.<br>
Every setting has a default value. The default value can be constant,
or it may depend on the current system settings. Once you edit a
setting it becomes "modified" and is shown in bold. To revert to the
default value, right-click on the setting.<br>

<br>
You can save the settings to an XML file, and later load them back.
Press the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Backup</span> button to access these functions. From there you can
also reset all settings to their default value.<br>


<br>


Press OK to store your settings. You need to restart Internet Explorer to apply the new settings.<br>


<br>
<h1><a name="admin"></a>Administrative Settings</h1>
The settings are
per user and are stored in the registry. By default every user can edit
all of their settings. An administrator can lock specific settings, so
no user can edit them. This is achieved by adding the setting to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\OpenShell\ClassicIE</span> registry key.<br>
<br>
You may also wish to not lock the setting but only override its initial
value. Then add "_Default" to the name of the registry value.<br>
<br>
The easiest way to know the registry name of a setting and its value is to modify it, and then look it up in <span style="font-weight: bold;">HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\OpenShell\ClassicIE\Settings</span>.<br>

Sometimes you may want to lock a setting to its default value, but you
don't know what the default value is. Then create a DWORD value and set
it to 0xDEFA.<br>

<br>

There is also a global setting <span style="font-weight: bold;">EnableSettings</span>. Set it to 0 in the
registry to prevent the users from even opening the Settings dialog:<br>

<img style="width: 656px; height: 292px;" alt="" src="images/settings_disable_ie9.png"><br>
<br>
Editing the settings through group policies is also supported. Extract the file <b>PolicyDefinitions.zip</b> found in the installation folder and read the document <b>PolicyDefinitions.rtf</b> for more details.<br>
