Win98Plus! Retro skin [Classic style] skin only for CSM 4.3.0<br /><br />Play ball.<br />Crack!<br /><br />It has extra qty 17 menu colors that match the Plus! theme for Win 98SE . <br />(sampled from WIN98Second Edition, as the Plus themes are built in. <br />Fonts and color vary a lot between 98,98SE, XP, low/high bit color settings.<br /><br />This skin is similar to XP Classic Retro , only simpler. No gradient top bar.<br />Win 98 only had the single column menu. This has the built in 3d borders, so skin can be used on Windows7,8,10.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />If you don't want to read lots, here is the short version:<br />If you just want to try out the different colored variations,<br />only download the skin file. If your computer does not have all the original fonts, subs will show instead.<br /><br />If you are a diehard fan, and want the text to look like original, download and install the Win98/SE fonts, and install them.<br />It's a BIG DOWNLOAD! Other programs on your computer might have installed the same fonts. Some are more specialized, <br />like &quot;Westminster&quot;, &quot;Franklin Gothic Demi&quot;, &quot;OCR A Extended&quot;,&quot;Abadi MT Condensed Light&quot;, &quot;Tempus Sans ITC&quot;, &quot;Matisse ITC&quot;,<br />&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;,&quot;News Gothic MT&quot;, &quot;Calisto MT&quot;,&quot;Copperplate Gothic&quot;, &quot;Lucidia Sans Unicode&quot;, &quot;Lucida Sans&quot;, &quot;Lucida Handwriting&quot;,<br />&quot;Century Gothic&quot;.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Here is the long extended version:<br /><br />The very last variation has skin text from R.O.B. <br />For me, this is experimental. It will take the system colors of themes, that are used in the High Contrast theme options. <br />It can also do the same with the theme colors in the &quot;Classic&quot; theme option of Windows 7. <br />Results will vary. I'm hoping it can be used in Win 10. It is like Ivo's &quot;Classic skin&quot;, that's used on Win7. <br /><br />!! Alert !!<br />Just be very careful about downloading Win98 themes for other operating systems. I downloaded the Win98plus! theme from :<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://ansonsterling.deviantart.com/art/Windows-98-Plus-For-Windows-7-155015314">http://ansonsterling.deviantart.com/art ... -155015314</a><!-- m --><br /><br />! !<br />Works in Win7, disaster in Win10, because there is no Classic theme engine in Win 10. <br />It screwed up the fonts and stuff, like they said it would. <br />Luckily I made a restore point just before using the theme- no good on W10 <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />This grey Classic downloaded one works ok in High Contrast theme in Win 10:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://kizo2703.deviantart.com/art/Windows-classic-theme-for-Windows-8-RTM-8-1-10-325642288">http://kizo2703.deviantart.com/art/Wind ... -325642288</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><br />This whole set of non plus! Classic themes from Winaero is ok. Just taskbar color not right in Win 10<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://winaero.com/blog/classic-themes-for-windows-8-classic-theme-brick-spruce-and-so-on-total-17-themes/">http://winaero.com/blog/classic-themes- ... 17-themes/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />The problem is, the above themes are all using the High Contrast theme option in Win 10, which ruins the look of web browsers .Ahhra <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br /><br /><br /><br />Winaero to the rescue <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> They have a link to the Plus! theme that plays the sounds, cursors, icons, and wallpapers, <br />safely in normal 7, 8 ,10 theme engine.<br />Granted, the windows borders and taskbar are colored in regular 10 fashion, <br />at least Ivo has made it relatively easy to match up taskbar color to match the menu skin color. <br />This theme is better than ones that use the high contrast theme option, because, well, those are too contrasty. <br />Here is the link to the good one:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://winaero.com/blog/get-classic-microsoft-plus-themes-for-windows-10-windows-8-and-windows-7/">http://winaero.com/blog/get-classic-mic ... windows-7/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />I assume, if say the original Baseball 98 theme, from ansonsterling was opened up in notepad, <br />and some, or all the [Control Panel\Colors] text was copied over to the Winaero baseball themepack (made by Shawn Keene), <br />then it could have matching colors for menu and window frames? Could be risky though. Don't know enough about it. <br />I did try making a simple baseball colors theme for Win10. It puts the baseball colors on the experimental menu variation.<br />I just don't know how to combine with all the sounds cursors,etc.<br />It won't work for me. Need a themester. <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Maybe Splitwirez knows how to combine it all together.<br /><br />Edit: About that baseball <strong>only colors </strong>theme I made. Quite funny. On this web page, as I'm writing this,<br />the browse for file upload button/window is tan color, same as baseball start menu. <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> Crazy. <br />Enough about themes.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Back to this menu skin.<br />The menu can have a built in Win98 caption text , or Win98 Second Edition one, or system caption text, or caption turned off.<br />Because skin can be viewed at 150 percent size, the caption looked very skinny. I had to look for bigger pictures of captions on net. <br />Never did find any, but got info on how to duplicate the text in photo editor using Franklin Gothic Heavy and Franklin Gothic Book font. <br />If anything, I did a better job making the 98 2nd Ed ,than MS original. I reused the same bitmaps to have simple 2 column with caption picture.<br /><br /><br />To get the menu text sharper and chunky looking , turn off &quot;font smoothing&quot; in CSM settings.<br />I never noticed the icon bars, and boxes on the menu, when I really had Win98. Probably coz monitors were not as sharp as Lcd.<br />If you don't like it, there is an option to disable it.<br />My computer can't use original 98 os.<br />I had to use Win98 inside Virtual PC on XP system. <br /><br /><br />There are a number of Win98 fonts,that are not included in Win 10. I put some of them in a folder.<br />Just click on their install button. If system has it already, cancel, because maybe a newer version works better.<br />Also. There might be a bug in the skin, or CSM program. Some italic font text has last letter partially cut off at the very end of word. Like a T, or y.<br />It's like there is not enough buffer zone around angled letters.<br /><br />Some of the fonts make the menu very wide. Adjusting CSM settings &quot;Main menu width&quot; to 30 and &quot;Sub-menu width&quot; to 30 looks better to me.<br /><br />That's about all I have to say. The coffee has worn off. <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <br />Experiment and Enjoy <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=856">juniper7</a> — Tue Sep 06, 2016 11:47 am</p><hr />
