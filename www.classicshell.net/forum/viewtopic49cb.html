		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Windows Blue will be out soon. . but Mr Classic Shell (ivo) is on a trip around the world. His cell phone is buried in his backyard. What evarrr. . . I am elsewhere and up for a ride - explore space both inner and outer. . . . . <br />oket this may not be the best scenario and I do not know Mr Classic Shell at all - even thought, he must be a smart guy who has a lot of potential. <br />There are lots of ways to go about it, but <br />my problem is that I rather trust this man than Microsoft. 6 million downloads is a statement. Even do Microsoft <br />claimed that it has sold more than <em>100 million Windows</em> <em>8</em> licenses. They had to admit that people do appreciate a <br /><em>start</em> button and want to use it.<br />lately, I attended a meeting where we discussed <br />guidance for training standard regarding Win8. Some of my colleagues and myself tryed to include Classic Shell as an recommendation in our papers. <br />To understand how to create real trust, you first have to understand what <em>causes distrust</em>. In one word: fear.<br /><br />So. . my question is, what if <br />a <em>piano fall from the sky</em> onto <br /><br />Mr Classic Shell<br />walking<br />down the road (knock on wood)?<br />Is there a plan B for the worst case szenario (e.g. it will be carried on as an OpenSource project - <br />without serious risk<br />)?<br /><br />No long talking. . . ehh sorry about that &gt; but I guess you get me!

I'm sure features that Mr Classic put in, and now MS is going to put in Blue, will be cancelled out in newer versions, to avoid conflicts. <br />Mr Classic is a very good man.<br />He is a professional coder, solving Windows user problems, just like an engineer, <br />and doing it for free, to the world.<br />Fear not.<br /><br />Don't worry <br />Be happy

As far as backup plan in the event of personal crisis; I don't think there is a second coder off hand to jump in and take his place, although in the long run, classic shell may or may not get picked up by someone else, and is already open source, so anyone in the world with coding skills, and a the will to work on it can get his hands on a fairly recent build. to branch out from on their own.. As Far as the files themselves, there here to stay on multiple hosting sites, so even if Ivo stops development at the very least, the current stable version will remain until its no longer compatible with whatever OS is released in the future <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

Was the T-Rex levitating in the first scene?<br /><br />PS: I just disabled the start button on Classic Shell and that seems to work okay. Check out some of my other post to see what I mean. And yes, Windows 8.1 still sucks.

Snowden. . . is the world that small, really? <br />Can’t believe I said that!<br /><br />The greatest remedy for anger is delay. -- purple monkey dishwasher<br /><br />Was surprised to get so much feedback in such a short period of time. Well, passion worth more than paycheck – only guessing. Don’t ask, don’t tell! Me lazy bone &gt; next time I will read more what other people wrote about similar topics instead of asking such silly questions. My apo-polo-logy to wast your time. Keep up the good stuff/work!!
